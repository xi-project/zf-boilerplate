# Zend Framework project template

## Directory outline

- */*: README and LICENSE files
- */application*: project-specific application implementation
- */data*: project-specific generic filesystem datastorage
- */docs*: project documentation; design documents, class schematics etc.
- */external*: external dependencies that cannot be included directly in /library, eg. git submodules
- */library*: generic class libraries which the application relies on (eg. Zend, Doctrine, Xi components), possibly symlinked from within /external
- */public*: files visible to the outside; index.php, CSS and JS files, images
- */scripts*: build and deployment scripts, database migrations, cron jobs
- */tests*: unit tests, acceptance tests, test fixtures and bootstraps along with possible test output (eg. code coverage reports)

### Application directory structure

- */application/configs*: configuration files
- */application/library*: domain classes (ie. models), any project-specific libraries, non-reusable content in general

## Running PHPUnit tests

You, reader, are expected to be a professional developer. Professionals make sure their code works. To be sure, you need to test it. Automated unit tests make it easier to test, enhance your design and help you make deadlines.

Writing these tests is up to you, but once you have any, we've got the bare minimum laid out for you to run them. You will get a  barebones unit test bootstrap with ´/tests/bootstrap.php´. It sets up an autoloader, the include path and notches error reporting up to maximum. ´/tests/phpunit.xml´ will serve to configure your PHPUnit runs if you wish to do so (code coverage reports? Yes we can!). To run PHPUnit tests:

  cd tests
  sh run.sh <arguments>

Extra arguments will be passed on to phpunit, but you won't usually need any. This is pretty much equivalent to running

  phpunit --bootstrap bootstrap.php --configuration phpunit.xml .

and will save you a lot of typing in the long run.
