<?php $webdriver = ExtendedWebDriver::typehint($this->webdriver); ?>
<h1>Front page</h1>

<p>
    This is an example of a <em>feature</em> document generated from an acceptance test.
</p>

<p>
    An acceptance test is a combination of documentation and test code
    describing a single feature of the system.
    The test is often a Selenium browser-based test,
    which gives the possiblity of screenshots such as the one below.
</p>

<?php
    $webdriver->get($this->baseUrl() . '/');
    $this->assertTrue(strpos($webdriver->getPageSource(), "acceptance testing mode") !== false);
    echo $this->screenshot();
?>

<p>
    The baseURL configured for acceptance testing is currently
    <code><?php echo $this->baseUrl(); ?></code>, which is where the above
    page was loaded from.
</p>

<p>
    We can even conveniently highlight parts of the screenshot.
</p>

<?php
    $this->highlight('#acceptance-test-mode');
    echo $this->screenshot();
?>

<p>
    These tests can work as simple version-controlled HTML TODO lists as well.
    Just specify a feature here as text (and perhaps some mockups) and
    gradually change it to a test as things get implemented.
</p>
